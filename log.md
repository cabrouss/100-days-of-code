# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked through entire Basic HTML & HTML5 modules on freeCodeCamp, and about half of the Basic CSS modules. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled today, for a few reasons. First, I woke up in a mood and have been fighting stress and anxiety all day. Second, I've been working on a Udemy course, "The Complete Web Developer in 2020: Zero to Mastery", and the whole style of learning is different. With freeCodeCamp, you read some text, then do some action related to the text, and cannot advance until you do. I feel like I've been more passive with the Udemy course. I'm uncertain which way is best (or maybe a hybrid study would be best). Going into the week, I want to keep up a pace of around two hours per day, while working full time.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
