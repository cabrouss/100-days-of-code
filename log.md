# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 20, 2019 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through entire Basic HTML & HTML5 modules on freeCodeCamp, and about half of the Basic CSS modules. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled today, for a few reasons. First, I woke up in a mood and have been fighting stress and anxiety all day. Second, I've been working on a Udemy course, "The Complete Web Developer in 2020: Zero to Mastery" (CWD2020), and the whole style of learning is different. With freeCodeCamp (FCC), you read some text, then do some action related to the text, and cannot advance until you do. I feel like I've been more passive with the Udemy course. I'm uncertain which way is best (or maybe a hybrid study would be best). Going into the week, I want to keep up a pace of around two hours per day, while working full time.

### Day 2: October 21, 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Work 14 hours today, so got up at 5:30 and started coding around 6:00. Continued CSS work on FCC, and Bootstrap with CWD2020.

**Thoughts**: Better mood today, clearer. I think early mornings are best for this process.

### Day 3: October 22, 2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: CWD2020, using Bootstrap to build a responsive landing page. Learned about meta tags, Bootstrap layouts and CSS.  

**Thoughts** Yesterday made for a very long day and I was exhausted by the end, which carried over into today. I'm not sure if I should do the morning coding on Mondays or if this was just an unusual week. Maybe if I went to bed earlier on Sunday night.
